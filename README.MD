This minecraft forge mod is an addon for GregTech6 and NEI and is a client-side mod.

It adds several NEI plugins for GT6 which shows the detailed information of GregTech's ore generation.
These plugins are:
* Plugin for vein generation (GT6)


### Build
If you want a bleeding-edge version of this mod, you can simply download or clone this repository, establish a folder named "libs" and put the dev builds of suitable version of NEI(e.g. 1.0.5.120-dev) and GT6(latest version) in the folder.
Then you can build this mod in the same way as building other mods. i.e. run "gradlew build" command in the CMD window. Then the build can be found in "./build/libs/" folder.

### License
I modified GTNEIOrePlugin for my modpack. I add support for latest GT6. You may NOT re-upload my files without my permission because I don't like to be caught in troubles.
